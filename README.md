## Description

The Employee Tracker is a command line run application that allows the user to view certain specifics about the information stored in a database of employees using MySQL and the Inquirer NPM. Upon starting the app, you will be presented with the options to "view all employees", "add employee", 'update employee role", "view all roles", "add role", "view all departments", and "add department". You will also be provided an option to quit. Most of these are self explanatory and work just as required, with the exception of "view all employees" which does not show the "department" column in the table.
